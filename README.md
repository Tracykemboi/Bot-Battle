Project Structure
Understanding the project's structure will help you navigate and extend the codebase effectively:

src/App.js:
The main component that ties together the bot collection and the user's army. This is where the state for enlisted bots is managed.

src/BotCollection.js:
Fetches and displays all available bots. Handles sorting and filtering logic and passes enlistment actions to the parent component.

src/YourBotArmy.js:
Displays the bots that have been enlisted. Provides an funtionslity to release bots back into the general collection.

src/SortBar.js & src/FilterBar.js:
Components for sorting and filtering the bot collection. These are highly reusable and can be extended for additional sorting/filtering options.

Customization & Extension
Feel free to extend this project to suit your needs. Some ideas:


Data Not Loading:
Make sure JSON Server is running and accessible at http://localhost:8001. If you've changed the port or endpoint, update the fetch URL accordingly.

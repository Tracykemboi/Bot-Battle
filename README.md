Bot Battlr
Welcome to Bot Battlr—your go-to platform for managing and battling with a collection of unique bots. This React application is designed with simplicity and flexibility in mind, allowing you to easily enlist, manage, and deploy bots in your army. Whether you're just getting started with React or you're a seasoned developer, this app provides a clear and scalable foundation to build upon.

Key Features
Bot Collection Management: View a comprehensive list of bots, each with its own attributes like health, damage, and armor.
Sorting & Filtering: Sort bots by various attributes or filter them based on their class for a more focused view.
Enlistment & Deployment: Add bots to your army with a simple click and manage your enlisted bots with ease.
Responsive UI: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or later)
npm (v6 or later)
JSON Server (for simulating the backend API)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bot-battlr.git
cd bot-battlr
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Running the Application
Start the JSON Server:
The app uses JSON Server to simulate an API for fetching bot data. To start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm run server
This will launch the server on http://localhost:8001.

Start the React App:
With the backend running, you can now start the frontend:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Project Structure
Understanding the project's structure will help you navigate and extend the codebase effectively:

src/App.js:
The main component that ties together the bot collection and the user's army. This is where the state for enlisted bots is managed.

src/BotCollection.js:
Fetches and displays all available bots. Handles sorting and filtering logic and passes enlistment actions to the parent component.

src/YourBotArmy.js:
Displays the bots that have been enlisted. Provides an interface to release bots back into the general collection.

src/SortBar.js & src/FilterBar.js:
Components for sorting and filtering the bot collection. These are highly reusable and can be extended for additional sorting/filtering options.

Customization & Extension
Feel free to extend this project to suit your needs. Some ideas:

Add Bot Classes:
Expand the FilterBar to include new bot classes or create a dynamic system that pulls classes from the backend.

Enhance UI:
The current UI is simple and functional, but you can always spice it up with animations, theming, or advanced grid layouts.

Implement Bot Battles:
The next logical step is to enable bot battles, where users can pit their enlisted bots against others.

Best Practices
Here are a few tips and best practices to keep in mind when working with this codebase:

State Management:
For simplicity, we're using React's useState. If your app grows in complexity, consider introducing a more robust state management solution like Redux or Context API.

Component Structure:
The app is structured to promote reusability. For example, the BotCard component can be abstracted to handle bot display logic in both the collection and army views.

API Integration:
Currently, we use JSON Server for local development. For production, you may want to integrate with a real backend service or database.

Troubleshooting
Error: Cannot resolve module...
Ensure all components are correctly imported and paths are accurate. A common mistake is missing or incorrect relative paths.

Data Not Loading:
Make sure JSON Server is running and accessible at http://localhost:8001. If you've changed the port or endpoint, update the fetch URL accordingly.
